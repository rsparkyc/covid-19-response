### Covid 19 Face Shields for Atlanta

#### tl;dr

ATTN Atlanta-area friends. We can help.
I've been following some of the developments happening in the global maker community as it relates to COVID-19. Lots of people with 3D printers are trying to help but there are questions. Masks are very much needed, but they can be complicated to make, so I've stayed away from them. Instead I am focusing on making face shields. There are lots of designs out there, but I think the one shown below is the most practical for what we're trying to do. It involves only a plastic frame and some transparency film/sheets.

**ATL MAKERS:** if you have a printer and want to help, please let me know. PETG is the preferred plastic because it can be sterilized easier (I've heard/read), but PLA could work too (I've heard/read). Microcenter in Marietta has rolls of PETG for around $21. I believe they're still open, but not sure.

Also, check out this website www.atlantabeatscovid.com, supported by the Marietta Maker Station and Decatur Makers.  They have a volunteer registration page and are trying to coordinate a larger effort.  I have reached out but will continue on my current path until they contact me and I can figure out which way to go...in the meantime, I want to keep making as many shields as possible

**ATL-AREA MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS:** We've been looking for takers for the shields and have found a couple of outlets. My friend Edgar Aceves work in Trauma at Grady. My friend Sheri Chernetsky Tejedor works at the CDC/Emory and they are sharing face shields.

If you work in industry or know someone else that needs face shields, please chime in.

**OTHERS:** There may be more ways to help, depending on how this goes. Donating and/or helping purchase supplies might be helpful as some of the materials might become harder to find. 

I'm trying to help as I can but still have a day job to keep up with... fortunately, Cris and the girls are very capable and have some time/energy too. 

-toby.
