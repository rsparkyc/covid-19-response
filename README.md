### Covid 19 Face Shields for Atlanta

#### tl;dr

ATTN Atlanta-area friends. We can help.
I've been following some of the developments happening in the global maker community as it relates to COVID-19. Lots of people with 3D printers are trying to help but there are questions. Masks are very much needed, but they can be complicated to make, so I've stayed away from them. Instead I am focusing on making face shields. There are lots of designs out there, but I think the one shown below is the most practical for what we're trying to do. It involves only a plastic frame and some transparency film/sheets.

### ATL MAKERS:
if you have a 3D printer and want to help, please read on. 

PETG is the preferred plastic if you have it because it can be sterilized easier (I've heard/read), but PLA can work too (I've heard/read). Microcenter in Marietta has rolls of PETG for around $21. I believe they're still open during this shelter in place period, but not sure.

One of the goals here is to find a way to produce as many of these as possible while using readily available materials and tools.  3d priinting works, but is a slow process.  I am looking at ways to produce more using CNC Routers and /or Lasers from flat sheet.  Tha could significantly speed up the process.  For example: https://www.protohaven.org/proto-shield/

The first model I saw was the Prusa design:  https://help.prusa3d.com/en/category/protective-shields_899  It's a great design but it has a long print time, due to the amount of plastic it requires.  Also, it requires an elastic band be added.

I then found out about the Verkstan (aka Swedish) design.  It is a bit thinner, meaning less print time and is pressure fit for most people.  If needed, elastic can be added.  The source for these is here: https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/protective-visor-versions/  but I've copied the STL's to make it easier to share and sort through some of the noise.  (see above)

The initial feedback so far has been positive and we are currenlty trying to keep printers running around the clock while we also look at additional scaling options.  If you would like to join, please find the appropriate STL(s)
above and get started.

Also, check out this website www.atlantabeatscovid.com, supported by the Marietta Maker Station and Decatur Makers.  They have a volunteer registration page and are trying to coordinate a larger effort.  I have reached out but not heard back yet.  I  will continue on my current path until they contact me and I can figure out which way to go...in the meantime, I want to keep making as many shields as possible

### ATL-AREA MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS:
We are connected with some local ER nurses and delivered our first batch of nearly 40 shields on Mar 29.  They are in short supply and were grateful to have them.  I attached this [note](Documents/Important-info-for-face-shields.md) to them

If you work in industry or know someone else that needs face shields, please chime in.

**OTHERS:** There may be more ways to help, depending on how this goes. Donating and/or helping purchase supplies might be helpful as some of the materials might become harder to find. 

I'm trying to help as I can but still have a day job to keep up with... fortunately, Cris and the girls are very capable and have some time/energy too. 

-toby.
