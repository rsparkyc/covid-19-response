We've printed well over 200 frames since Mar 27.  There are lots of files out there and lots of opinions.  We've had the most success with the current file:

### Best current design set working for us:

### Stacking for the win!
Stacking this type of print is the best approach.  Instead of having to babysit the printer and swap out prints every hour or so, we've been able to set it and forget it.  It's been very handy for overnight prints.  As described below, there has been some tweaking and there may be some more to come.

We learned to set the print and let it run long enough to print at least 2 as a test.  The best part of a stack is you can stop it at any time and only lose the top unit.  This is great for testing, power surge, running out of filament, crash, etc.

| X  |Mar 31   | [Zacca Remix2](https://github.com/tboneATL/covid-19-response/tree/master/shield-designs-for-3d-printing/Zaccanigno-Remix)  | AZ removed lip and thickened the bar.  Running both printers with stacks of 20.  Great results.  |
|   |Mar 30   | Zacca Remix  | Andrea Zaccagnino graciously modified this design for me.  Switched from solid brow to mostly open design  |
|   |Mar 28   | Verkstan  | Less material = faster prints = more shields. Press fit.  Can add elastic if needed.  Printed 60 or so of these before changing design. Using stack prints to optimize, but this print doesn't fare well with stacked prints. |
|   |Mar 27   | Prusa RC3   | Popular design, slow prints because of thickness.  Requires elastic band.   |
