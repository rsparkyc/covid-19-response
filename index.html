											<h1>What We're Doing</h1>
											<p>Making Face Shields. Not Masks. Not organizing or recruiting. Not looking for credit. Not selling or marketing anything.</p>
										</header>
										<p>We are a just family with a couple of 3d printers and a laser cutter that is trying to help. We are not trying to recruit or organize others. We have learned a lot and want to share in case it can help others who are looking to do the same thing in their community.
										We started printing shields on Friday, Mar 27.  We did not create this idea or the original designs, but have made some changes to help us make more of them.

										<p>There is a huge community working on this, including the Facebook group called "Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies".  Designs and ideas opinions and data are constantly evolving ...there may be better solutions out there.  We've changed 4 times in 4 days to optimize and adjust based on feedback.
                                        <h2>Looking to print face shields?</h2>
										<p>Again, there are many ways to do this, but here's what we've been doing...</p>
										<ul>
											<li>We are building with 2 components: Plastic frames and clear shields
											<li>Currently using a variant of the Verkstan (aka Swedish) frame design that is very popular</li>
											<li>Using transparency film from Office Depot for the shield material.  Can be 3-hold punched and trimmed with scissors.  We are using a laser cutter.</li>
											<li>With 2 printers (Prusa Mk2 and Rostock Max v2), we are now producing 60-70 per day out of our kitchen.  We have friends that are doing something similar.</li>
										</ul>
											<p>Inspired by this design:
